## 2026-05-01 - Prevent prototype pollution during parser construction

**Vulnerability:** A prototype pollution vulnerability existed in `packages/format/src/parse.ts` where properties like `__proto__` and `constructor` were blindly set on constructed objects if supplied in the serialized payloads.
**Learning:** This occurred due to the custom parsing logic taking untrusted external strings and assigning them verbatim to dynamically created objects via bracket notation.
**Prevention:** Filter out `__proto__` and `constructor` keys before property assignment in all object construction paths within parsers.
